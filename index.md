pitch: A very brief, one-line description of your project

---

The purpose of this project is to develop a comprehensive, community-driven repository of detailed, service-specific threat models that support accurate and practical threat modeling across widely used cloud, container, and web services such as AWS S3, EKS, NGINX, PostgreSQL, and OAuth.

This project aims to bridge the gap between generic threat frameworks and the specific security challenges posed by modern infrastructures by providing actionable threat descriptions, multiple categorization perspectives, mitigation guidance, and integrations with existing security tools. Ultimately, it empowers developers, security architects, and operations teams to design and assess systems with better-informed risk management, improving overall security posture in evolving technology landscapes.

### Road Map
The first year roadmap for the OWASP ThreatAtlas project will focus on establishing a strong foundation, building community engagement, and delivering valuable, actionable threat intelligence. The roadmap includes the following key phases:

* *Months 1–3: Project Setup and Initial Research*
** Establish project governance, define scope, and onboard initial core contributors.
** Conduct comprehensive research to collect existing threat data for top services (AWS S3, EKS, NGINX, PostgreSQL, OAuth).
** Develop templates and documentation standards for threat entries.
** Launch project website and repository for open access and contributions.
* *Months 4–6: Threat List Development*
** Populate the repository with detailed threat entries covering prioritized services, including multi-framework categorizations (STRIDE, MITRE, CWE, CVSS).
** Begin peer review process for accuracy, relevance, and completeness.
** Publish initial cheat sheets and example threat models demonstrating practical application.
* *Months 7–9: Community Building and Outreach*
** Host webinars, workshops, and community calls to engage security practitioners and domain experts.
** Promote contributions and feedback to enrich threat data and broaden service coverage.
** Integrate feedback and enhance documentation and contribution guidelines.
* *Months 10–12: Refinement and Integration*
** Implement tooling integrations and APIs for easier adoption in threat modeling and security assessment workflows.
** Prepare the first formal project release with updated deliverables.
** Plan for expanding service coverage, ongoing maintenance, and long-term sustainability.
